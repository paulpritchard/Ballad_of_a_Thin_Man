# *Ballad of a Thin Man*: an illustration of the Bob Dylan song
© Paul Pritchard, 2023

This repository concerns my illustration below of Bob Dylan's song *Ballad of a Thin Man* from his great 1965 album
[*Highway 61 Revisited*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited).
I discuss how the illustration reflects the key components of the song,
discuss each of the various characters individually,
and tell how the project was conceived and carried out.

## The setting

The setting for the illustration is a party at [Andy Warhol's Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory)
in New York City in the mid-1960s.
The Factory was decorated in meth chic style, with silver paint and tin-foil and mirrors,  Warhol's prints displayed on the walls,
and a distinctive shabby curved red velvet couch.
The Factory's floor was concrete.

## The song

The song concerns a presumably thin man called "Mr Jones" who is "very well-read, it's well-known"
(he's even "been with the professors" and "been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books"),
but who is extremely unsettled and anxious.
So our man is represented by the quintessential anxious intellectual New Yorker, Mr Woody Allen.
He has a pencil in his hand, as specified in the song.

Mr Jones "see[s] somebody naked" in the first verse, and asks "Who is that man?".
The answer is Joe Dallesandro, a typical (if that is possible) member of Warhol's crew,
who was a nude model and gay icon, and featured in several Warhol movies, starting with *Lonesome Cowboys* in 1968.

A "geek" "walks up" to Mr Jones and hands him a bone.
The word "geek" back then meant something like a circus freak. A gross man, one might say.
The geek is represented by Dylan's manager at the time, Albert Grossman, who is shown handing Woody Allen a rolled up sheet of paper,
representing his standard contract.
The paper looks like a bone,
and the idiom "to throw (or hand) someone a bone" means to give them something that is not valuable.
Dylan sacked Grossman soon after when he discovered he was ripping him off on song royalties.

A "sword-swallower" comes up to Mr Jones, "clicks his high heels", kneels, and says
"here is your throat back, thanks for the loan".
He is represented by Leonard Bernstein, who is offering his red handkerchief to the distressed (and sweaty?) Woody Allen.
The sword references the baton that Bernstein famously wielded in his role as conductor,
and "sword-swallower" references his sexual predilections, which fit with his appearance at a Warhol party.
And the red handkerchief looks like a throat.

Mr Jones then notices a "one-eyed midget".
He is represented by Paul Simon, who is what used to be called vertically challenged,
and whom, as a singer-songwriting rival, Dylan would have delighted in disparaging.

Some other people shown in the illustration also fit in with the song, contributing to Mr Jones's disquiet and unease.
They are represented by the very unconventional (one might say "queer") pair of the art photographer Robert Mapplethorpe,
wearing the kinky leather gear he favored, with his hand on Woody Allen's shoulder,
and the drag queen Divine.

Robert Mapplethorpe's (female!) lover is also shown, representing one of the arty types that gravitated to Warhol.
She was a poet. Her name is Patti Smith.

Dylan himself is observing all this from his seat in the corner of the famous Warhol couch, thinking "there's a song in this".
Seated beside him is Rico "Ratso" Rizzo, whose friend (and male prostitute) Joe Buck is standing close behind in his cowboy clothes.
The movie *Midnight Cowboy* (1969) was based on them. It featured a party just like this one.
Rico would have told Dylan some wild stories. Perhaps his song *Desolation Row* was based on them.

Rounding out the partygoers are Andy Warhol himself, with the camera he often carried,
and Lou Reed, who played at Warhol's Factory parties as a member of the band
[The Velvet Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground), which was managed by Warhol.
It went nowhere fast.

Finally, there's the hired help, a young man working as a waiter to help pay his way through film school.
His name is Martin Scorsese.

## Dramatis Personae

### Bob Dylan

<img src="image/Bob_Dylan.jpg" align="left" width="200px" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;">

[Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) was born in 1941.
He moved to New York City in 1961 to join the burgeoning folk scene.
In his early golden period, in the 1960s, he released 9 groundbreaking albums of original folk and then rock music.
*Highway 61 Revisited*, from which our song is drawn, is a serious contender for his greatest masterpiece.
Dylan was introduced to Andy Warhol in 1965, by Dylan's then lover, the model and socialite [Edie Sedgwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edie_Sedgwick).
Warhol subjected him to one of his so-called "screen tests",
and Dylan took an Elvis painting for his trouble, which he later traded for a couch (not Warhol's one).
In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

## The making of the artwork

Since I have aphantasia (literally no visual imagination), I have to work hard to get ideas for my paintings.
The advent of text-to-image generative AI therefore appealed to me as a source of visual inspiration,
with the bonus that I could experience firsthand what I consider one of the greatest engineering feats of my former field of work,
Computer Science.

Text-to-image starts with text, and lyrics of favorite songs appealed as a source.
A painting based on Leonard Cohen's *Famous Blue Raincoat* turned out well.
So I thought I'd try a more complex song.
*Ballad of a Thin Man* appealed because of its very inscrutability.
I did not realize how challenging it would prove to be.
I started with the open-source Stable Diffusion on my own modest PC to generate prototype components of the illustration,
but did a lot of subsequent image manipulation and drawing using Affinity Photo and Procreate.
Many thousands of images would have been generated as the artwork evolved.

The original conception was semi-realist; something in a Neo Rauch vein.
But I couldn't generate any starting material with a tone that I was happy with.
Eventually, I decided the tone had to be satirical.
With the cast of characters growing by the day, I settled on something like the Mad Magazine movie parodies of my youth in the 1960s,
which had the virtue of belonging to the same time period as the song.

When Nana Banana Pro was released I could finally achieve the results I imagined (non-visually!).

So this artwork is intended as a tribute to that golden age of illustration,
and in particular [Jack Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Davis_(cartoonist)),
whose amazing vitality it unfortunately lacks.
Hence the [Alfred E. Neuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman) Warhol-style print on the wall.
The subject of the other Warhol-style print is the sort of thing I imagine Jack Davis might have chosen,
had he lived in our time.

## The movie poster version

Inspired by Jack Davis's great movie poster for "Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", I adapted my cartoon in a similar fashion.
